# Odin Kittens

This project was created as part of the [Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/kittens-api). The goal of this project was to set up the Rails app to be a data-producing API. Through this project, I was able to produce a website that would be both a normal HTML-producing back end AND an API that could be used to pull data from it.
